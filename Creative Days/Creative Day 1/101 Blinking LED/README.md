# 101 Blinking LED
Equipment: dip switch, resistors, 10 LEDs
1.  This starts with the classic Arduino beginner project, download the Blink code from Examples. 
2.  Use the breadboard and an LED on pin 13, with a protective 220R resistor, to make it blink on and off using the Blink example code. 
3.  Change to code to vary the frequency of the blink.
4.  Incorporate the dip switch on pins 2, 3 and 4, with 220R pulldown resistors, to change on duration, off duration and whether the LED comes on at all.
