# 101 Blinking LED
Equipment: Arduino Uno, breadboard, dip switch, 220R resistors, LEDs
1.  This starts with the classic Arduino beginner project, download the Blink code from Examples. 
2.  Use the breadboard and an LED on pin 13, with a protective 220R resistor, to make it blink on and off using the Blink example code. 
3.  Change to code to vary the frequency of the blink.
4.  Incorporate the dip switch on pins 9, 10 and 11, with 220â„¦ pulldown resistors, to change on duration, off duration and whether the LED comes on at all.
