# 101 Blinking LED
Equipment: HERO board, breadboard, 3-pole dip switch, 1 x 220Ω resistor, 3 x 10KΩ resistors, LED, jumper cables
1.  This starts with the classic Arduino beginner project, download the Blink code from Examples | 01.Basics. 
2.  Use the breadboard and an LED on pin 13, with a protective 220R resistor, to make it blink on and off using the Blink example code. 
3.  Change to code to vary the frequency of the blink.
4.  Incorporate the dip switch on pins 9, 10 and 11, with 220Ω pulldown resistors, to change on duration, off duration and whether the LED comes on at all.
5.  Print out the state of switches to the Serial Monitor as a 3 digit binary number.
