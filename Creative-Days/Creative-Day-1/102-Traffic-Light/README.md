# 102 Traffic Light
Equipment: HERO board, breadboard, 3-pole dip switch, 5 x 220Ω resistors, 3 x 10KΩ resistors, 2 x red LEDs, 1 x yellow LED, 2 x green LEDs, jumper cables

1. Use three LEDs to make a simple traffic light. The cycle of lights should be:
    1. Green on for 1.2 seconds (1200ms)
    2. Yellow, flashing for 1.4 seconds (1400ms)
    3. Red on for  1.2 seconds (1200ms)
    4. Yellow 

2. Use the first switch of the DIP switch to control the speed of the cycle of the lights - Switch off = slow cycle, Switch on = faster cycle. 

3. Use the second switch of the DIP switch to turn the traffic lights on or off. The lights should turn off after a completed cycle.

4. Use the third switch to include the pedestrian crossing lights into the cycle. The cycle of the lights should now be:
    1. Green for 1.2 seconds (1200ms) + Pedestrian red light on
    2. Yellow, flashing for 1.4 seconds (1400ms)
    3. Red for 
    4. Pedestrian 
    4. Yellow
