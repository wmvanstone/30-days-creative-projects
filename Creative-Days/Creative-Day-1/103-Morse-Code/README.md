# 103 Morse Code
Equipment: HERO board, breadboard, 3-pole dip switch, 1 x 220Ω resistor, 3 x 10KΩ resistors, LED, jumper cables
1.  This starts with the classic Arduino beginner project, download the Blink code from Examples | 01.Basics. 
2.  Use the breadboard and an LED on pin 13, with a protective 220R resistor, to make it blink on and off using the Blink example code. 
3.  Change to code to use the LED to blink a message in Morse code. 
4.  Incorporate the dip switch on pins 9, 10 and 11, with 10KΩ pulldown resistors and use the DIP switch to select different messages

### Helpful Hints
Here is a handy [Morse Code Look Up Chart](https://www.codebug.org.uk/learn/step/540/morse-code-alphabet/), and you can use [this website](https://cryptii.com/pipes/morse-code-translator) to translate a message into Morse Code, and back again.

Here are the rules of writing Morse Code:
1.  A dot is 1 time unit
2.  A dash is 3 time units
3.  The gap between dots or dashes within a letter is 1 time unit
4.  The gap between letters is 3 time units
5.  The gap between words is six time units
