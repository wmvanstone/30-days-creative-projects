# 105 LED Scanner

## Equipment:

HERO board, breadboard, 3-pole dip switch, 8 x 220Ω resistors, 3 x 10KΩ resistors, 8 x LEDs, jumper cables

## Instructions:
Use a series of LEDs to create a light "scanner" effect, like [KITT from Knight rider](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwmolzsESC8). Connect the LEDs in series with resistors and use the DIP switch to control which LED pattern is used at any given time. For example, you could light up one LED at a time in sequence, LEDs can light from left to right, from right to left or from the outside in, depending on the DIP switch setting.
