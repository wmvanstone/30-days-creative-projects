# 106 - LED Dice

## Equipment:

HERO board, breadboard, 3-pole dip switch, 8 x 220Ω resistors, 3 x 10KΩ resistors, 8 x LEDs, jumper cables

## Instructions:

Version 1:

Create a digital dice using 6 LEDs. Use the DIP switch to "roll" the dice and randomly light up one of the LEDs to represent the result. Use the [random() function](https://reference.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/random-numbers/random/) and the [randomSeed() function](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/random-numbers/randomseed/) to generate the random numbers.

Version 2:
Create a digital dice as in version1, but this time using 7 LEDs representing the spots on 6-sided dice.
