# 108 Fade

## Equipment:

HERO board, breadboard, 6 x 220â„¦ resistors, 6 x LEDs, jumper cables

## Instructions:

Use the built-in example code in Examples | Basics to change the brightness of one LED using pulse width modulation PWM. Extend this to include six LEDs on the PWM capable pins with ~ signs, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10 and 11. (PWM is introduced after day 5, but it is possible to use this example code without understanding how PWM works.)
