# 109 Blink Without Delay

## Equipment:

HERO board

## Instructions:

Use the built-in example code, File>Examples>02.Digital>BlinkWithoutDelay, to control a blinking LED using the [millis() function](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/time/millis/) to determine the elapsed time in milliseconds, rather than the delay() function. (You will learn more about variable types on Day 7.)
