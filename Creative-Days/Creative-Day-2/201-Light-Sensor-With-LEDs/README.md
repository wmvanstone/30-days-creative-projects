# 201 Light Sensor with LEDs

## Equipment:

HERO board, breadboard, 1 x photoresistor, 10 x 220Ω resistors, 1 x 10KΩ resistors, 10 x LEDs, jumper cables

## Instructions:

Use a photoresistor to read the light level and use the LEDs to indicate whether it's bright or dark. 
Calibrate the sensor so the ambient light level illuminates 1 LED and maximum illuminates 10 LEDs.
